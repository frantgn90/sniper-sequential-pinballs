This script is the responsible to translate traces get from real executions to traces that allows a multiscale simulations between Dimemas and Sniper.

Both pinballs to Sniper and Paraver trace to Dimemas are extracted from the same execution. Those parts that are 'traced' by the pinballs are marked as events on the trace that will be simulated on Dimemas. This script gathers this information and manage them in order to ease the work of Dimemas.
